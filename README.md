<h1>Seminar report: Price changing factors in the European natural gas market and how does it affect the renewable energy market</h1>

<h2>Interpretation of the topic</h2>

In all over Europe there was an increasing tendency in the natural gas prices in the past months as results of several events like the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused less investment and less maintenance in the gas fields, moreover countries returned to their full economic capacity which resulted in a higher demand for natural gas. These existing problems were further aggravated by the Russian-Ukrainian war and in accordance with it the fact that the Russian Gazprom decided to keep the Nord Stream pipelines shut down while in the 2019 â€“ 2020 period Russia imported more than 40% of the natural gas to the EU market.

These are only some of the factors that caused sudden changes in the last few years in the gas prices, but there are other issues and factors as well that have been around for a longer time period and together with the above-mentioned recent events they caused an energy-crisis, that might lead to changes in consumer behavior after more than doubled gas prices in Denmark for example but similar changes happened in all over Europe.
